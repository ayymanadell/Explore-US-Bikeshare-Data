# Explore US Bikeshare Data Project

## Overview
Welcome to the Explore US Bikeshare Data project! In this project, we delve into the world of bike sharing by analyzing data from bike-sharing systems in three major cities in the United States: Chicago, New York City, and Washington, D.C. We'll use Python to build an interactive program that allows users to explore and uncover insights from the bike sharing data.

## Dataset:
The dataset used in this project contains information about bike sharing in the three cities. It includes data on the start and end times of trips, trip durations, user types, and more. The data comes pre-loaded in CSV files for each city and forms the basis for our analysis.

## Features:
The interactive program built for this project offers the following features:

- Users can filter data by city, month, and day of the week.
- Users can view summary statistics for the data.

## Usage
To explore the bike-sharing data and interact with the program:

1- Clone the repository to your local machine.\
2- Make sure you have Python and the required libraries installed, as mentioned in the requirements.txt file.\
3- Run the Python script to initiate the program and start exploring the data.\

## How It Works
- The program interacts with users via the command line. It prompts the user to filter the data based on their preferences and then presents the relevant data and visualizations accordingly. The user can choose to analyze data for specific months or days of the week and view statistical summaries of the dataset.



Let's hop on and explore the fascinating world of bike-sharing data in the US! Happy biking and analyzing!
